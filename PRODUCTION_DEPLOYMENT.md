VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Deploy
- Netlify will automatically deploy on push to main
- Monitor build logs for any issues
- Test the deployed application

## üîß Vercel Deployment

### 1. Connect Repository
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings

### 2. Build Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Add the same environment variables as Netlify.

## üîí Security Configuration

- Tree shaking active
- Minification configured
- Source maps disabled for production

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached for 1 year
- API responses cached appropriately
- CDN configured for global delivery

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track real-time performance

## üö® Post-deployment

### Testing
- [ ] All features work correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates functional
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tested
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable

### Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring
- Configure error alerts
- Monitor user analytics
- Track performance metrics

### Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Database maintenance

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions (Optional)
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run lint
```

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- **Google Analytics**: User behavior tracking
- **Sentry**: Error monitoring
- **LogRocket**: Session replay
- **Vercel Analytics**: Performance monitoring

### Setup
1. Add tracking codes to index.html
2. Configure error boundaries
3. Set up performance monitoring
4. Configure alerts

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check Node version and dependencies
- **Environment variables**: Verify all required variables are set
- **Real-time issues**: Check Supabase configuration
- **Performance**: Monitor bundle size and loading times

### Support
- Check deployment logs
- Review browser console errors
- Verify database connectivity
- Test in incognito mode
